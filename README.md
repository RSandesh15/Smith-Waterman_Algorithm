The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a widely used algorithm for local sequence alignment in bioinformatics. It was first published in 1981 by Temple Smith and Michael Waterman. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to identify the optimal local alignment between two sequences. It works by creating a matrix of scores that represents all possible alignments between the two sequences. Each cell in the matrix represents the score for a specific alignment position. The algorithm then identifies the highest scoring diagonal in the matrix, which corresponds to the local alignment between the two sequences. The Smith-Waterman algorithm is commonly used in many bioinformatics applications, such as protein structure prediction, gene finding, and comparative genomics. It is particularly useful for identifying similarities between closely related sequences that may have diverged over time due to mutations or other evolutionary processes.
